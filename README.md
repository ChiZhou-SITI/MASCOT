# MASCOT: Model-based Analysis of Single-cell CRISPR knockOuT screening

* **MASCOT** is the first one-step applicable pipeline based on topic model to analyze single-cell CRISPR screening data, which could help to prioritize the knockout gene impact in a cellular heterogeneity level.
* **MASCOT** is an integrated pipeline for model-based analysis of single cell CRISPR knockout screening data. **MASCOT** consists of three steps: **data preprocessing**, **model building** and **knockout effect prioritizing**: 
    * **Data preprocessing**: Besides the routine quality control and data normalization applied in single-cell RNA-seq analysis, **MASCOT** addresses several considerations that should be taken into account for such a novel data type: (1) Filtering out cells with an extremely large proportion of zero knockout expression among the control cells, as these cells are inherently noisy or meaningless. (2) Reducing the false positive rate of gene knockout and (3) Filtering out knockout cells without a sufficient number of cells to capture the corresponding perturbation phenotype;
    * **Model building**: **MASCOT** builds an analytical model based on Topic Models to handle single-cell CRISPR screening data. The concept of topic models was initially presented in machine learning community and has been successfully applied to gene expression data analysis. A key feature of topic model is that it allows each knockout sample to process a proportion of membership in each functional topic rather than to categorize the sample into a discrete cluster. Such a topic profile, which is derived from large-scale cell-to-cell different knockout samples, allows for a quantitative description of the biologic function of cells under specific gene knockout conditions. **MASCOT** addresses several specific issues when applying the topic model to this specific data type: (1) Differences between sgRNA knockout efficiencies is are considered and rectified in the evaluation of the knockout effect on the corresponding cells. (2) The distribution of topics between cases and controls is affected by the ratio of their sample numbers, and such a sample imbalance issue is addressed when evaluating the knockout effect. (3) The optimal topic number is automatically selected by MASCOT in a data-driven manner.
    * **Knockout effect prioritizing**: Based on the model-based perturbation analysis, **MASCOT** can quantitatively estimate and prioritize the individual gene knockout effect on cell phenotypes from two different perspectives, i.e., prioritizing the gene knockout effect as an overall perturbation effect, or in a functional topic-specific way. 
* **Input data format description**:  
* For illustration purposepurposes, we only took the unstimulated cell data applied in CROP-seq as a an example plot.<br>
    * Install: you can install the **MASCOT** package from Github using **devtools** packages.
    ```r
    require(devtools)
    install_github("BinDuan/MASCOT")
    library(MASCOT)
    ```
